 Prototypes of some VR game concepts



## 3D Jigsaw

http://127.0.0.1:8000/AframeProjects/vr-game-prototypes/3d-jigsaw/

Uses CSG to decompose the 3D model into parts.
Rays from controllers can be used to grab the pieces and move them.
I didn't yet implement the part where they stick back together again...!  (beginnings of this are in "piece-matching" branch).
Would also be nice to preserve the object texture through the CSG dissection.  Not yet looked at how to do that...





### The Castle

A 3D environment - I've not yet decided what to do with it...
